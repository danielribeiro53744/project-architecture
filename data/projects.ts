      "The Glass House Retreat is a minimalist residential project that explores the relationship between indoor and outdoor spaces. Floor-to-ceiling windows blur the boundaries between the interior living areas and the surrounding natural landscape. Sustainable materials and energy-efficient systems are integrated throughout, including solar panels and a rainwater collection system. The open floor plan maximizes natural light and creates a sense of spaciousness, while thoughtful zoning ensures privacy where needed. Inspired by modernist principles, this home represents a harmonious balance between functionality, aesthetics, and environmental responsibility.",

By removing unnecessary walls, we created an open concept living space that maximizes both light and functionality. Custom built-in storage solutions eliminate clutter while maintaining the clean aesthetic. A restrained material palette of white walls, pale oak flooring, and black accents creates a timeless foundation, punctuated by carefully selected furniture pieces that combine comfort with sculptural forms. Lighting was a key consideration, with a layered approach that includes ambient, task, and accent lighting to create different moods throughout the day.",

Designed to be installed on bodies of water, this modular structure appears to hover just above the surface, creating a mesmerizing visual effect. The pavilion's translucent panels change appearance throughout the day as light conditions shift, while also allowing views through to the water below. Conceived as a multi-purpose space for exhibitions, performances, or contemplation, the design can be adapted to various contexts and needs. This conceptual project explores themes of temporality, reflection, and the boundary between built and natural environments.",
